# Autonomous Navigation on road
## Task 1: Autonomous Lane Keeping  
Given an on-track camera video, calculate the steering angle of the vehicle to track the lane, and design appropriate HMI to intuitively display the steering control in the image. (First program)
## Task 2: Road sign Recognition
Given an on-track camera video, recognize the stop sign and school zone sign in the video and mark them using bounding boxes. (Second program)
## Task 3: Communication
Send the road sign information from the 2nd program to the 1st program through communications.The two programs can be on either the same computer or two different computers
## Task 4: Vehicle Control
Design appropriate HMI to intuitively display control commands (e.g., STOP SLOW DOWN) in the image at stop sign and school zone sign in the lane keeping program.
